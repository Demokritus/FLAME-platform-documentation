# Guides

The following manual is split into three distinct categories depending on the user's
usage intention of the PHT. They may...
* ... use the PHT as a **user**. A user intends to access Personal Healthcare for scientific
analysis. As a user you can view the following guide for further information.\
[(User guide)](../guide/user/index)

* ... use the PHT as an **administrator**. An administrator intends to allow public access for users to their
Personal Healthcare data. They are responsible for managing their uploaded data and for reviewing the use of it.\
[(Admin guide)](../guide/admin/index)

* ... **deploy** their own PHT project. With the deployment guide we allow for our work to be used in other 
related/similar projects and endeavors. For use of our code or any other resource or concept, please
view our [Terms of Use]() first though.\

# Components
Several Git repositories contain the components of the FLAME. 
Third party components can be found on the respective manufacturer's site.
These components can be roughly separated into the following categories:

* Hub
* Node

All **public** repositories can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/PrivateAim).

## Hub
Central components/services are individual packages within one monorepo. They include the implementation of the Central 
UI, Analysis Managing, Result Extraction, API, etc., which supply the core functions of the FLAME hub.

# Deployment guide

## Introduction
The deployment guide is intended for people, who want to deploy parts of the PrivateAim infrastructure.
To be more specific, we will explain how to set up a local node, and how to set up a hub instance.

**Note:** The setup for the local node is necessary for the administrator role (see [here](./node-registration)).

## Overview
For setting up either a local node or the hub instance the following instructions are prepared:

**``Node``**
- [Registration](./node-registration)
- [Installation](./node-installation)
- Optional [troubleshooting](./node-troubleshooting)

**`Central`**
- [Introduction](./central-introduction)
- [Nginx](./central-nginx)
- [Harbor](./central-harbor)
- [App](./central-app)

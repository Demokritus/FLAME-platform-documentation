# Deployment Guide

## Introduction
The deployment guide is intended for people, who want to deploy parts of the PrivateAim infrastructure.
To be more specific, we will explain how to set up a local node, and how to set up a hub instance.

**Note:** The setup for the local node is necessary for the administrator role (see [here](./node-registration)).

## Overview
For setting up either a local node or the hub instance the following instructions are prepared:

**``Node``**
- [Registration](./node-registration)
- Installation
    -  [Setup microk8s and Helm](./microk8s-quickstart)
    -  [FLAME Node Deployment](./node-installation)

**`Hub`**
- [Introduction](./hub-introduction)

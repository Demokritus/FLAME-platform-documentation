# User guide

## Introduction
We address this guide to analysts and other users. By contacting the administrator of your realm or organization,
you will receive access to the FLAME hub interface.

Users utilize the FLAME as a means to safely access medical data. Suppose they intend to analyze using a specific dataset
or study offered in the FLAME hub. In that case, they may first create a so-called Proposal in which they announce their interest to
the administrator(s) responsible for the data. Each side will review this ``Proposal``, and if approved, it can be used,
among others, to configure a federated analysis. The nodes, which is how the local setups reading the data are updating results using APIs.
Upon arriving at a node, the administrator may review the analysis script contained in the code and then execute it on their data. The models or results of the analysis will be returned
to the analyst without nodes requiring to transfer input data outside their organization.

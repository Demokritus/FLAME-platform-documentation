# User Guide

::: warning Important
This guide serves as an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and “Hello World” example for developers testing the FLAME
platform.
It is intended for basic functionality testing and initial exploration. A more comprehensive and detailed guide will be
available soon, covering all aspects of the platform in depth.
:::

## Introduction

This guide is designed for analysts and users seeking to leverage FLAME for secure medical data analysis.
To begin, contact us for access to the FLAME hub testing interface via Discord.

FLAME enables users to safely access and analyze medical data without transferring sensitive information outside their
organization.
Analysts can create a “Proposal” within our MVP to request access to a testing dataset.
Upon approval, analysis scripts are executed on local nodes. Results are returned to the analyst, maintaining the
integrity of the original data.

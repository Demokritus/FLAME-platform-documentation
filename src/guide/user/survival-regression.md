# Single round aggregation using

This example shows how a simple aggregation of local regression results can be performed using FLAME using functionalities of `fedstats`.\
We conduct a Cox-regression at every node and aggregate the results. Aggregation is done by weighting all single coefficients by
their inverse variance (diagonal of Fisher information matrix). More details of the method can be found, for instance, in &nbsp;[1](#ref-willer2010).\

## Procedure

As this is an illustrative example, we make some simplifications concerning the data and the model.\
The full procedure is like this:

1. A Cox regression model is calculated at each node using `CoxPHFitter` from the `lifelines` package.
    1.1 Load dummy data using `load_rossi()` from the `lifelines` package and sample 50% of the data to reduce power.
    1.2 Fit the model.
    1.3 Extract relevant info from the model (point estimate and standard deviations)
    1.4 Return it as a list of tuples from `analysis_method()`, that is expected format for the aggregation.

2. Aggregation using `MetaAnalysisAggregation` from `fedstats` and compare it with full data.
    2.1 Fit model on full data (load data on aggregation node and fit again a Cox model) for reference and extract relevant info.
    2.2 Aggregate results from nodes by initializing a `MetaAnalysisAggregation` instance and use `aggregate_results()` and get relevant info.
    2.3 Return all results as one `pandas.DataFrame` that can be downloaded from the HubUI.

> [!NOTE]  
> Info about `StarAnalyzer`, `StarAggregator`, their mandatory components and the `main()` function can be found in other tutorials.

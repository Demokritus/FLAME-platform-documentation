# Project
A project on the FLAME platform serves as a collaborative unit for specific research or analysis tasks.
It includes an initial risk assessment and a high-level description of the requested data and nodes.
::: warning Important
In the future, this entire section will be replaced by the FDPG+ API integration during the platform’s transition to productive usage.

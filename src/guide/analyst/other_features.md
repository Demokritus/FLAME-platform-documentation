## Homomorphic Keys
If you want to create a train that uses Homomorphic encryption, you will have to create a *homomorphic key-pair*; this is done similarly.
Only select the **Homomorphic**-button in step 3.

[//]: # (1. Start the application)

[//]: # (2. From the opening page select **Secure Addition**)

[//]: # (3. Generate key-pair &#40;Public & Private Key for Homomorphic Decryption&#41;)

[//]: # (4. Select the corresponding Private Key &#40;identical steps as in section hash signing&#41;)

[//]: # (You need to know the total age and total number of patients over all sites. By saving both decrypted numbers,)

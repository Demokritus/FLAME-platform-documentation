# Project Review
A Project is an organizational unit, which represents the collaboration between different participants in regard to a specific research or analysis project.  
It contains an initial risk assessment as well as a high level description of the requested data.

In the **Home** section press **projects** in the menu on the left-hand side.
At first, you will lead to the **outgoing**-projects section, where you can see a list of all the projects created by this node. Via the searchbar you can filter after the name.
You have the option to adjust the already existing projects via the **List**-icon or to delete the project via the **bin**-icon. Furthermore, you can see, who exactly created that project.

Moreover, you have the option to switch to the **incoming** section or to create a new project on the left side between the menu and the overview-list.

# Analysis Review
As a node administrator, you have a crucial role in analysis: If your node was part of an approved proposal, the
analyst who set it up can create analyses with your node. Before a valid analysis is built, it requires approval.
Here, you may review the analysis code and see whether your provided node data will be used according to the study
protocol. If it is, approve the analyses. If it is not, you may reject it, effectively blocking its execution on
your site. If you do so, we encourage you to inform the data analyst of the reason, so they can revise it. After approval
or rejection of each site, the analysis is built.

To review analysis, follow these steps:
1. Within the home area (top left), you need to select **Analyses** in the left navigation, and then the Option
   **Incoming** to its right.
2. Here, you can view all approved, rejected, as well as analyses awaiting either (Optional: Use the search bar at the
   top).

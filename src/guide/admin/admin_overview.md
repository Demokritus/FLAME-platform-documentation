# Overview

## What is your role as an admin in the PHT?

As an Admin, you will be responsible for managing the users on your realm, as well as reviewing proposals and trains. You will also manage the trains as you run them at your stations. 
The tasks are mainly performed in two interfaces, the central UI and the station software. 

## What is the central UI?

The User Interface (UI) [https://pht-medic.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de](https://pht-medic.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/) is the central control interface 
to interact with the PHT. Its main tasks are the administration of stations and train proposals
but also the submission of analysis-trains and consequently receiving encrypted results.

# Train Review
As a station administrator, you have a very important role when it comes to trains: If your station was part of a
fully approved proposal the analyst user who set it up is able to create trains with your station as a halt. Upon its
execution, it will naturally make a stop at your station requiring approval. Here, you may review the analysis code and
see whether the station data under your responsibility is used correctly. If it is, approve the train so it may make its
way to the next station. If it is not, you may reject the train, effectively stopping its execution. If you do so, we
encourage you to inform the data analyst of the reason, so that they get the chance to revise it.

In order to review trains follow these steps:
1. Within the home area (top left), you need to select **Trains** in the left navigation, and then the Option
   **Incoming** to its right.
2. Here, you can view all approved, rejected, as well as trains awaiting either (Optional: Use the search bar at the
   top).
